More information [here](https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-01-airbus-to-provide-poland-with-a-very-high-resolution-optical)

My mission is to integrate multiple subsystems in the ground segment while ensuring security best practices are enforced.  
To do so, I automate releases and develop helpers scripts
